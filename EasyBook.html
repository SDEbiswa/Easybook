                   <h3>Q - Can I avail domestic flight offers on easybook?</h3>
                   <p>A: Of course, you can. While making domestic flight bookings, you can avail any special offer that is active at that time.

                   <h3>Q - How can I avail budget air tickets on easybook?</h3>
                   <p>A: It’s super-easy to avail budget airfare while booking your cheap flight tickets on easybook. Just select the ‘Price’ filter once the available flight options are displayed and adjust according to your convenience. On the easybook app, you can select the downward arrow, which will show the lowest airfare at the top and continue downward in ascending order.</p>

              <div class="qna third">
                   <h3>Q - Why could I not avail the flight booking offers at the time of checkout?</h3>
                   <p>A: Easybook makes use of a world-class real-time reservation database to list airfare and availability. As dynamic changes in airfare take place, or the available flight tickets sell out, the database reflects the changes in real-time. Hence, we suggest, you double-check online flight booking prices when purchasing flight tickets, as the airfare might have been dynamically updated since you first selected the air travel dates or planned your itinerary.</p>
